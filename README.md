# Software Developer Salary Prediction using Machine Learning with Streamlit

## Project Description

Welcome to the Software Developer Salary Prediction project! This repository houses a machine learning application designed to predict software developer salaries based on various factors such as experience, location, education, and more. Leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and the interactivity of Streamlit, this project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for estimating potential salaries in the software development field.

### Key Features

- **Interactive UI with Streamlit**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their details and receive immediate output salary predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Dicision Tree and GridSearchCV, to provide accurate salary predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust data preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed EDA to understand the underlying patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
- **Deployment**: Ready-to-deploy Streamlit application that can be easily hosted on platforms like Heroku or AWS.

### Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (Latest)
